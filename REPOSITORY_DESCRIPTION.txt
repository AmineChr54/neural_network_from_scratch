DESCRIPTION TEXT (Alternative versions):
----------------------------------------

Version 1 (Concise):
A Python implementation of a neural network built from scratch using NumPy for handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset.

Version 2 (Detailed):
Educational neural network implementation built entirely from scratch without ML frameworks. Features custom backpropagation, ReLU/Softmax activations, and gradient descent optimization for MNIST digit classification.

Version 3 (Focus on learning):
Learn neural network fundamentals by exploring this from-scratch implementation. No TensorFlow or PyTorch - just pure Python, NumPy, and math for MNIST digit recognition.
